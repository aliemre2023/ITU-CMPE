abstract = {In the past couple of years, several digital watermarking schemes have been proposed and based on DCT, DFT, and DWT transformations. In this paper, a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking scheme is proposed. SVD transformation preserves both one-way and non-symmetric properties, usually not obtainable in DCT and DFT transformations. In the proposed scheme, both of the D and U components are explored for embedding the watermark. Experimental results show that the quality of the watermarked image is good and that there is strong resistance against general image processing. Furthermore, the extracted watermark can still be easily identified after tampering.}
